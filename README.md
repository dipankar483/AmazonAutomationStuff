# AmazonAutomationStuff

************Project Description***************

1. The Amazon Automation project is created using Cucumber framework of BDD type
2. We can run the test through the following ways:
	a. through Junit (from eclipse/intelliJ).
	b. through mvn commands which we can integrate later with Jenkins for CI/CD purposes(through command prompt)	
3. Generated html report(in /target/cucumber-html-reports) in pie chart graph,where you can see the details of the test cases executed, for both pass and failed ones. 
4. Since it's a Cucumber based we can run the code for both desktop and mobile(appium is recommended pratice as it has lot of benefits)
5. Many things have been hardcoded due to limited availablity of time crunch, which can be further sub-divided through utils and other ones.
6. Have made some modifications in your requirements like the pincode have to entered first for the avialbility of the product and I have choosen renew product midnight green as the available product asked for login to cover end to end scenario which was not possible without login. Hope you understand!
